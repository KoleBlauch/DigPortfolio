This web-portfolio is meant to display the digital composition skills I have learned over the course of this semester. The visual argument and infographic are examples of different approaches to persuasive messages. Each has a different style and would be applicable in different circumstances. A infographic about movie theaters may do well on a university campus, or a a high school. The visual argument, however, demands more from the reader. Such a sign would be ideal at a ski resort or a coffee shop. The soundscape was a new form of content that I had never created before. Audio in general is a field of digital composition in which I am new. It was a learning experience to go capture audio and try to recreate the same experience without visuals. Moving forward, this site will grow to eventually encapsulate all of my work. Ideally, it will become my main reference in terms of work experience.
