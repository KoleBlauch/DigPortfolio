Looking over my website, I am left with two feelings; as far as appearance goes, there is certainly work to be done - but the format of the site is very maleable and easy to work with. In the literal sense, I successfully coded a web portfolio. However, having taken several coding classes before, I know how important the visual aspect is. As with any presentation, the website is a reflection of who I will be as an employee. Employers will appreciate visually appealing work and could be persuaded by that alone. I will have to do more research with CSS going forward, because I struggled the most with remembering code calls (mainly periods before certain elements in CSS) and styling. The style portion of the website became too time consuming, which forced me to keep it simple. This will be a website I continue to use and work on because it is set up where I can upload every document into a template efficiently. Once the visuals compliment the layout, this will be an extremely useful resourse.
